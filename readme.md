# Yelp Camp Version 1.0

A Social Media Application that lets users share and rate camping spots that they have been to.

## Tech Used

Some of the tech I used to create this project.
* MongoDB   - Database
* NodeJS    - Server-Side Code
* EJS       - HTML Templating
* Express   - Server Routing and Managment
* Mongoose  - MongoDB ORM
* Passport  - User Auth and Login

## Dashboard

After a user signs up and logs in they will be directed to the campgrounds page. From here people can add campgrounds they have been to and share details and comments with other users on the site.

## Campground

Click on a campground will bring you to a detailed page about that campground. If you are the creator of the post you can edit the campground otherwise you can view all the information about that campground and other user comments.


## Start your own project

Feel free to clone this repo and build your own version of News Line!

After you have cloned the repo simply run:

`npm install`

`npm start`

You will need to have a mongoDB server running to use the database. After you have installed mongo run this command in another terminal to run the mongoDB server.

`mongod`
